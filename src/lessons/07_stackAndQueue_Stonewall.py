# You are going to build a stone wall. The wall should be straight and N meters long, and its thickness should be
# constant; however, it should have different heights in different places. The height of the wall is specified by an
# array H of N positive integers. H[I] is the height of the wall from I to I+1 meters to the right of its left end.
# In particular, H[0] is the height of the wall's left end and H[N−1] is the height of the wall's right end.
#
# The wall should be built of cuboid stone blocks (that is, all sides of such blocks are rectangular). Your task is to
# compute the minimum number of blocks needed to build the wall.
#
# Write a function:
#
# def solution(H)
#
# that, given an array H of N positive integers specifying the height of the wall, returns the minimum number of blocks
# needed to build it.
#
# For example, given array H containing N = 9 integers:
#
#   H[0] = 8    H[1] = 8    H[2] = 5
#   H[3] = 7    H[4] = 9    H[5] = 8
#   H[6] = 7    H[7] = 4    H[8] = 8
# the function should return 7. The figure shows one possible arrangement of seven blocks.
#
#
#
# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
#
# N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
# each element of array H is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].


def solution(H):
    stack = []
    block_count = 0    # The number of needing blocks
    for height in H:
        while len(stack) != 0 and height < stack[-1]:
            # If the height of current block is less than the previous ones, the previous ones have to end before
            # current point. They have no chance to exist in the remaining part.
            # So the previous blocks are completely finished.
            stack.pop()
            block_count += 1
        if len(stack) == 0 or height > stack[-1]:
            # If the height of current block is greater than the previous one,
            # a new block is needed for current position.
            stack.append(height)
        # Else (the height of current block is same as that of previous one), they should be combined to one block.
    # Some blocks with different heights are still in the stack.
    block_count += len(stack)
